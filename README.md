# Java Attitude App

Well, this app was borne out of a desire to find out words that add up to 100 just like attitude does.
If a = 1, t = 20, etc, attitude = 100.
So, I hear people say that yeah ... attitude is everything merely because the letters add up to 100.
Well, it makes sense for motivational speeches but the naughty side of me decided to write a program that takes words 
and checks the sum of their individual letters in that manner to see if I'll find a word that adds up to 100 just like 
attitude does ... especially a word that does not depict something good like attitude does... just to debunk that 
attitude = 100% claim... 

P.S. This is just for fun. I don't intend to discourage people from having good attitudes in any way... 

Okay ... Well, I found some interesting words that add up to 100 after creating this program and running 700 nouns that 
you can find in the nouns.json file.

They are [analysis, attitude, culture, delivery, discipline, hospital, inflation, session, stress, variety, writing]

If you're kinda idle and you'd like to run other words through this program, you can do so by selecting words from the 
words.json file. I'd advise you to select them in batches though because I have over 300,000 words in that file.
Let me know if you come across interesting/crazy words that add up to 100.

Enjoy!
